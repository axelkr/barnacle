\section{Context of product use}
On a regular basis, I want to know how the teams are currently doing. I do this by tracking KPIs and also looking into individual teams. Those teams unfortunately can use their own software for task tracking and hence I would have to learn to use that software. Moreover, I cannot compare individual teams as easily.

In a discussion with a team, I want to have a common ground in talking about their performance. I also want to share with them what's important to the organization as a whole. To this end, I'd like to relate what the team does with what's important to the organization.
