\section{Context of product use}
During the day, we usually work towards a set of goals we promised to deliver on a given date. We track the tasks and their progress in a software we've picked in the past.

On a regular basis, we meet and discuss what impeded us and how we can improve. Then we'd like to have a glance at our performance since the last time. We'd like to get pointers on which aspects to have a discussion about.
