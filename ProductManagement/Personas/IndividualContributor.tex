\section{Context of product use}
At the start of the day, I'll have a look at all my tasks and pick the ones that are important. I'll do them throughout the day and report them in the individual teams. At the end of day, I want to know what I've accomplished throughout the day. 

At times, I also want to prepare for a meeting to determine whether there's anything I need to report as late. Moreover, I'd like to summarize what I've accomplished since the last meeting.

At times, I want to have a broader view of the past weeks and discover ways to improve. To this end, I need to have a quick look at all tasks but also tasks per project to find any patterns or track KPIs.
